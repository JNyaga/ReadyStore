# READY STORE

- This is a django api created to aid in creation of`ecomas` application by exposing endpoints which make it easier to access needed services without building entire backend for ecomas.

Ready store API can be accessed at [ReadyStore](https://readystore.onrender.com/) `[ReadyStore](https://readystore.onrender.com/)`

Or deployed locally ðŸ‘‡

## Installation/Usage locally

#### Requirements:

- python3.9
- docker installed -(for redis)
- mysql installed(with default ports`3306` open)
- For`windows` its preffered to use`wsl` to run project but it will do with just the normal service

### Install redis

Best option is to run redis on docker

```python
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

### Install `pyenv` to manage python in OS:

- **Linux(**recommended**)-**>[How to install &#39;pyenv&#39; Python version manager on Ubuntu 20.04 (hashnode.dev)](https://brain2life.hashnode.dev/how-to-install-pyenv-python-version-manager-on-ubuntu-2004)
- **Windows->**[pyenv-windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)

> After installing as per instruction in above

Run ðŸ‘‡ in `powershell` or `terminal` to install python 3.9 to system:

```bash
 pyenv install 3.9
```

#### Install `pipenv` to manage project environment:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

**Then** clone the project above

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JNyaga/ReadyStore.git
```

In the `storefront/settings/dev.py` file input the values of your `mysql database` or any database you may choose(read django docs for other databases). Add the `DATABASE` setting and do as follows

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': '[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]',#choose the name you wish for you database(any)
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'USER': '[YOUR_USERNAME]',
        'PASSWORD': '[YOUR_PASWWORD]'
    }
}

```

- Open the folder and run the following commands:

```bash



#To install the required modules
pipenv install -r requirements.txt

#Activate the environment
pipenv shell

#Run the migrations
pipenv run python manage.py makemigrations
pipenv run python manage.py migrate

#Populate database
pipenv run python manage.py seed_db

#Create admin user:
pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser #follow the steps that follows

```

### USAGE:

Access the api at `https://readystore.onrender.com`

For `local` to run the API service you run

```bash
pipenv run python manage.py runserver
```
